I, Mateusz herby present you our own GitHub repository for our optimalization project.
For with every class we will just add more functionalities to it, I propose to make it general repository, and simply commit changes made to it.
I have also made data folder for storing output data from everything we will need, inside it I have made data1 folder already for storing data from the 1st iteraton of the project. Inside it there is data1.csv file, in which we will store data from first 100 measurments of the program. The other two hundrets will be stored in separate files, so that we will know what parameters we have used.
I will add more data folders in the future when needed.
